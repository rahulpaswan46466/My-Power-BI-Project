Hello Everyone. It's My Another Project On The Topic Of Data Analysis And This Time I Took The Help Of Power Bi.
#
If someone is not very familiar with this tool, let me explain it briefly.

PowerBI as a tool for business intelligence is powerful and primarily used by data analytics experts. It displays and analyzes live data from many sources, including cloud and on-premises. It is an integral part of the Microsoft Office suite and can be used with Excel to visualize large sets of business data using dashboards, reports, and graphs.

All-in-all, it is an advanced analytics tool that enables you to analyze your data quickly. If you want to transform your business and be more data-driven and agile in decision-making, itâ€™s essential to use the right tools, and Power BI should be at the top of your list.
